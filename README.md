# Micropub endpoint

This is the source code for a [micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) endpoint that can be hosted with [Glitch](https://github.com). There it lives as a server to receive `POST` requests and then use the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to push changes to a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site (in particular a static site built with Jekyll).

- Micropub is a standard format for publishing content yourself.
- Glitch hosts Node.js web apps/servers for free.
- GitHub pages hosts static sites or sites generated by Jekyll for free.

This endpoint in particular posts content to [`jlord/micropub-content`](https://github.com/jlord/micropub-content).

Create your own micropub endpoint and Jekyll site in seconds!

## Endpoint

Set your your own server on Glitch with this code:

1. Create a `hello-express` project on [Glitch](https://glitch.com).
2. Import this repository.
3. Edit `.env` with your info. (URL of the Jekyll site).
  - `REPO=https://github.com/jlord/micropub-content`

## Jekyll site

To make a static site generated by Jekyll:  

1. Fork [`muan/micropub-content`](https://github.com/muan/micropub-content).
2. Edit `_config.yml` with your info.

And you're done! The Jekyll site might take a minute to build. But then you can head to [https://muan-micropub-client.glitch.me/](https://muan-micropub-client.glitch.me/) and log in with your Jekyll site URL to create your first post. There is even a `feed.rss` that you can use for [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).
